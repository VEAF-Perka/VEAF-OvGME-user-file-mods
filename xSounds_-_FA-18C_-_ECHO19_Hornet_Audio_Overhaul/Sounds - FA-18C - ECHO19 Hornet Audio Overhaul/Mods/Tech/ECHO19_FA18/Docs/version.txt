v2.0.0 (21/02/2019)

- Whisking effect in F2/F3 view should no longer be audible.

NEW / TWEAKS:
- Replaced "around" sample with cleaned up, more audible version.

v1.1.1 (23/12/18)
 - Bumped volume up for most samples for extra punch.

v1.1 (22/12/18)

- Adjusted some samples' gain structure

v1.0

Release ver.



known issues/wishlist items:

* HOWL / SIREN EFFECT: activates 100% of time while in flight, varies on speed, non dependent on camera pos. ED API issue.
* MID-LEVEL FLIGHT FLYBY: there aren't any "flyby" warping sounds that the hornet has IRL, however cannot add any due to API restriction.
